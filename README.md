**How to get this project up and running**

To see this site working we have two options.
* Go to the site that is live on [Heroku](https://capitalcityweather.herokuapp.com/) 
* Run the site on your own machine.
	1. Clone or download this project repository.
	1. Request the "secrets.json" file from me. Email me at earyzhe@gmail.com or pm me on Github.
	1. Once you have the secrets.json, add it to the project root folder.
	1. Install the required npm packages by executing the bash command "npm install" in project root folder.
	1. You can launch the app with nodejs, by entering the command bin/launch from the project root.
	1. Go to your web-browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ to see the page.

If none of theses methods work please contact me for support.

Below was the coding challenge this project is for.ß

##Coding Task##
The task is pretty open ended and the time allotted is up to you, though please limit yourself to a few hours maximum.

**Directions:**
Using Javascript and any frameworks/libraries you’d like, make a request to a free API, then format and display the resulting data on a page.  A simple set of Javascript and HTML files is acceptable, but feel free to show off your skills by adding your own features if time allows. Please use your best judgement for any open questions. There are no right/wrong ways to implement this.

Your solution should be provided as a link to a Github repository with a README on how to get it up and running.
