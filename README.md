# How to get this project up and running #

To get this site working we have two options.
* Go to the site that is live on [Heroku](https://capitalcityweather.herokuapp.com/) 
* Run the site on your own machine.
	1. Clone or download this project repository.
	1. Request the "secrets.json" file from me. Email me at earyzhe@gmail.com or pm me on Github.
	1. Once you have the secrets.json, add it to the project root folder.
	1. Install the required npm packages by executing the bash command "npm install" in project root folder.
	1. You can launch the app with nodejs, by entering the command bin/launch from the project root.
	1. Go to your web-browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ to see the page.

If none of theses methods work please contact me for support.
