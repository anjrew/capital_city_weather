**Coding Task**
The task is pretty open ended and the time allotted is up to you, though please limit yourself to a few hours maximum.

**Directions:**
Using Javascript and any frameworks/libraries youâ€™d like, make a request to a free API, then format and display the resulting data on a page.  A simple set of Javascript and HTML files is acceptable, but feel free to show off your skills by adding your own features if time allows. Please use your best judgement for any open questions. There are no right/wrong ways to implement this.

Your solution should be provided as a link to a Github repository with a README on how to get it up and running.
